## 1 - Creating and Running a Process (1) - fork

### 1.1 & 1.2

Fork creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. This new process is refferenced as the "child process".

The child process has a unique PID, different from his parent process.

fork() returns the PID of the child process in the parent process, and 0 in the child process.

### 1.3 Parent Child Program

see code file

### 1.4 

```
int i = 5;
if (fork() == 0)
{ 
// I’m the child
    i++;
    printf("%d\n", i); //I added this line to verify that this line was indeed executed
} else {
    // I’m the parent process 
    sleep(3); // sleep for 3 seconds ; why ?
    printf("%d\n", i); }
```

If we compile and run this code (see full code here), it outputs :
```
6
5
```
You can see that the condition if(fork()=0) is true inside the child process.

### 1.5 

See this code.

## 2 - Creating and running a process (2) - exec 

### 2.1 

The  exec()  family  of functions replaces the current process image with a new process image.

We use execvp(*char[]) to execute a program. We've putted the full path of the executable ("/bin/firefox") but with execvp we can just
